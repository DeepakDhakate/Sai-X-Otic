            <p>
                SAI XOTIC has been in the uniform sector since 2009 and was established by Swapnil Dhanvijay with very
                limited resources. With ample knowledge about the business, Mr. Dhanvijay managed to establish a name of
                the company, while maintaining quality and service. Till date the company has a strict policy of
                maintaining the best quality in terms of fabric, stitch and service, apart from customer satisfaction.

            <p>
                At SAI XOTIC we provide the best products for education, hospitality, industry sectors and every
                possible corporate set up, where uniform is an everyday habit and expression. A uniform helps to define
                equality among people who
                work/educate/learn under similar circumstances. Our team is not just responsible for the products but
                also helps to bring about confidence with the design and fit. We strongly believe that a piece of
                clothing can be of no meaning, if the person wearing it does not own it. This is where our customized
                products are highlighted and make us the most quality driven with cost effectiveness.

            <p>There are indeed other players in the market, who also provide competitive products. However, at
                SAI XOTIC we believe that we walk a few extra steps towards customization and customer satisfaction
                which could be challenging with the large production lots without compromising on quality. Additionally
                we are never the ones who abandon the client after dispatch. Service continues even after the final
                delivery to make sure that the client is left satisfied.</p>

                <h3>Value For Products</h3>
                <p>At SAI X-OTIC we make sure that the products are of optimum quality and refuse to deal in the cheaper
                    products that do not ensure longevity. It is important for us to see if we are happy with the
                    quality of products that we are dealing with, only then we would have the confidence to show it off
                    to our clients for approval. Our prices are of top notch quality that come with a competitive price.

                <h3>Value Added Services</h3>
                <p>Dispatch is just a step towards the completion of the order from the client and our quality control
                    department makes sure that they are in constant communication with the clients. Although bulk orders
                    seldom come with any issues, but in case of any, our post dispatch team makes sure that all the
                    issues are resolved till customer satisfaction.</p>

                <p>Our product rates are reasonable and competitive while providing value for money. No compromise
                    whatsoever is ever made in terms of quality. At SAI X-OTIC we also understand that the consumers
                    look for the best products at the best rates and we promise to deliver what we preach.</p>

                <h3>Attractive and Flexible Uniforms</h3>
                <p>Our uniforms stand out in the crowd. The Uniform industry is a place where poor quality fabric is
                    generally used for bulk production. But our policy at SAI X-OTIC is to make use of the best possible
                    fabric for uniforms, which are carefully handcrafted by our artisans in the factories while giving
                    personal attention to each product.</p>

                <h3>Quality Products</h3>
                <p>Quality is something that we never compromise on. Quality control is a factor where we pay special
                    attention post production. This is a crucial time when the products are sorted as per quality and
                    even the slightest fault detected makes us discard the product altogether. Replacement is a promise
                    that we make even in case, if the client is not satisfied in terms of fit and fabric.</p>

                <div class="border"></div>
                <h3>On Time Delivery</h3>
                <p>Delivery commitment is made at the time of placing the order or when we receive a purchase order.
                    Usually, the time is based on the order size or the availability of the fabric. The time and
                    commitment is often mentioned in the proforma invoice. We seldom miss any delivery commitments. In
                    case of any we make sure to communicate in a timely manner.
