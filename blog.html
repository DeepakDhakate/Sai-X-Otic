                <h1>Points To consider while purchasing uniforms</h1>
                <img src="img/dotted underline.png" alt="">
                <ul>
                    <li><span>Nature of work -</span> The client needs to first identify nature of work who are about to
                        wear the uniforms. For instance, who are the people who are going to be allotted with uniforms.
                        If the person is deployed  for laborious work then it should be considered that the person
                        should be wearing uniforms with fabric that is durable and also comfortable.</li>

                    <li><span>The weather conditions -</span> Geographical conditions have to be considered before
                        finalizing uniforms. The educational institute, a set-up from the hospitality sector, a factory
                        or any kind of corporate set-up could be located at a place where it could be cold, humid or
                        hot. </li>

                    <li><span>Budget -</span> The client needs to first determine the budget of the uniforms per
                        employee/student/worker. This makes it easy for us to present the options that they could have
                        in terms of fabric and stitch.</li>

                    <li><span>Pattern -</span> Any said pattern that a company or an educational institution follows
                        could be redesigned. We can continue with the current pattern as well. However, we also have a
                        team of designers who can provide fresh designs for those who are considering for a change.</li>

                    <li><span></span>  Some of the most commonly selected fabrics include matte, cotton, linen, polyester cotton and sometimes full polyester.</li>

                    <li><span></span>  Typically, people only look at the style, print, and brand of the fabric. Examining the fabric quality is often overlooked, despite the fact that it is one of the most important criteria when choosing a fabric for a uniform.</li>

                    <li><span></span> Uniforms are used on an everyday basis. This is the reason you might end up washing it frequently, which can make the uniform look dull and lifeless.</li>

                    <li><span></span>  In order to maintain the brightness of the fabric, it is recommended to use good quality detergent along with a laundry additive to wash your uniforms.</li>

                    <li><span></span>  Optionally, you could also use a fabric softener at the end of the wash cycle in a washing machine. If you are washing by hand then you could add the fabric softener during the last rinse. (Usage of fabric softener for white clothes is not recommended)
